Over two weeks, implemented three simple card games. 

1. Top Card
Player will be dealt three cards. Player selects a card. The card is compared with the Computer Player’s card. The player with the highest card gets the points. This process happens for three rounds before a winner/result is announced. 

2. Triples 
Player will be dealt three cards. Draw a card and discard a card until all your cards are the same – hence, Triples. Whoever matches first all three first wins! If the draw pile finishes before the combination is achieved, a tie is declared.

3. Crazy Eights
Player will be dealt eight cards. Card played must match the suit or the number of the up-facing card (Unless it is an eight). If there are no matching cards in player’s hand , select 'DRAW' to display one from the deck. Eights and Aces are special cards. An eight indicates Wild Card can be placed on any suit or number and player selects a new card to play. Ace indicates the other player's turn is skipped. Do this until all cards in hand are played.
